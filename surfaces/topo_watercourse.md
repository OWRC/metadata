## ORMGP Topological Watercourses

### Description 

The [Ontario Hydro Network (OHN) - Watercourse](https://geohub.lio.gov.on.ca/datasets/mnrf::ontario-hydro-network-ohn-watercourse/about) layer offered by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry has been analyzed based on a spatial analysis to define a connectivity network and a directional graph. Watercourse channel segments are topologically correct, meaning that every segments is defined by its upstream and downstream segments.

### Methodology

* **Data Source - Ontario Hydro Network (OHN) - Watercourse**
    + See Source [**metadata**](https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/a222f2996e7c454f9e8d028aa05995d3/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=default&output=html) 
    
* **Vector Processing**
    + OHN watercourse layer is reprojected to EPGS 3161

    + Watercourses are *"segmentized"*: polylines are defined as single linear features from junction to junction.

    + Certain stream segments were manually removed in order to prevent "unnatural" flow connectivity. (This commonly occurs along man-made canal routes such as the Trent-Severn waterway.)

    + An adjacency matrix is built to collect segment endpoints that are close to one another. Adjacency is assumed to imply segment connectivity.

    + topological ordering is then performed, attributing segments with their appropriate Strahler (1952) code.
